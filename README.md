Collection of Appium automation tests on a real iOS **device**. yep. not simulator. Also contains related scripts.

## Pre-Requisites for all tests
1. Appium and its dependancies are installed (Run appiumUninstaller.sh followed by appiumInstaller.sh to clean up and reinstall. These files are available [here](https://github.com/rajfidel/appium_ios/tree/master/scripts))
2. Apple Developer Account. (Extremely important)

## appium-uicatalog
This project uses the UICatalog.app application available from the Apple Developer page as a sample app on which automation tests are run.

## scripts
Installer and Uninstaller scripts for Appium for iOS.

## support_files
Support files used by multiple appium projects.
